👋 Hey there, I’m **Wenchi**, an MS in Business Analytics student at UCIrvine, graduating at the end of August 2024.   

🌱 My toolbox: Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI and more!  

🚀 I’m open to data-driven roles in any industry, with a strong passion for Finance and Tech.   

📫 Let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wen-chi-tseng/"link")—would love to chat!    

⚡ Fun fact(not work related...) about me: Racing through the pool as a competitive swimmer for over 10 years/ Overanalyzing my coffee choices— because yes, I’m that serious about my caffeine. :)
